            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently moving towards furthering my career in the music business. Between managing, being an artist and repertoire, or agent, my final goal is to work for a record label then branch off on my own. As I am working towards my own record label, I will be a co-host, produce, and direct a podcast. Ultimately, I will be a respectfully known black entrepreneur.</p>
